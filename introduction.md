Mosh Java Video Series
All videos: Drive (must be logged into CareerDevs email)  >>>   **_https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WaQw8KwhjHL4JoSvWUgk6Ym9mTqUwqKa_**

Before you start:

~~Complete >> Create a repository that will store all the code you create as you follow along with Mosh and create projects from this curriculum.~~

Suggested name: JavaFundementals

Within your repo you will create a Java IntelliJ project. At the root of this project you will store your notes. You can create a master notes sheet or break it down into folders/directories. Whatever style you choose, be consistent.
~~You must create a text file in your JavaFundementals project called “java-terms-of-art.txt” within your “notes” folder~~
Priority

Each section has a different level of importance to us as an all around great developer
Each section will be colored to reflect the level of importance

Highest priority
Moderate priority
Lowest priority
Review and Understand:
Create notes for each section. Upload them along with the code you write as you follow along with the videos. Take your time with each video. You are free to slow-down or speed-up the videos as you watch them.

Intro:
1) Getting Started
   3- Anatomy of a Java Program
   Create a text file in your JavaFundementals project called “java-terms-of-art.txt” within your “notes” folder
   Store the following terms in your text file
   Define the terms: method, class, function, field, variable
   Define the terms in relation to each other. ie a method is a function, defined within an object…a function is…
   Commit changes to this file as you add more definitions and explanations
   4- Your First Java Program
   Complete this code in the project you first created(JavaFundementals), commit the completed code to GitHub when done
   5- How Java Code Gets Executed
   Know the difference between interpreted and compiled languages
   Define the terms and explain the difference between interpreted and compiled in your terms of art text document. Commit when complete

   Complete every video in this section

   By the end of this section be able to
   define “control flow”
   create control flow logic and justify your control flow choices by comparing to other types. ie “I use if/else statements instead of switch statements because…”

Add any definitions and examples to your JavaFundementals project. You can continue to add to your terms of art document. Try to organize this text file by creating clear labels to break up the video sections ie BASIC TERMS, DATA TYPES, CONTROL FLOW
